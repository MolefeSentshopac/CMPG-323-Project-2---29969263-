# CMPG-323-Project-2---29969263-

This project is the creation of an API that will be used by users who interact with it to enable users to enter data that will be stored on the cloud through the Sql databse on microsoft azure for safety where data will be stored in each relevant table in the database. The project's API is built in .NET Core Web in the project the API is connected to the data source using a code ran on package manager console using a database string of which the database is hosted on the cloud which is used to manage the API, this project thus has methods that help it perform its function which include the get method that gets the data from the database the delete method which deletes data from the database the post method that will create a new device entry on the database as well as the patch method that will update an existing device. with different methods that perform different functions for the API to fullfil its function and to be of use to users, the users use the HTTP to gain access to the API for resources the API might be able to offer them by it in term deriving or passing down data to the database in the cloud. The API also has intense heavy security such as authentication that includes a username and a password. Users can use the API to store new data or to retrieve old data from the database as well as to delete the data in the API.
